# Pong-Royale
A multiplayer 4 way pong game battle royale game.

### Requirements
- Uses pygame and basic python libraries.
- A friend or three.

### How the game works
Similarly to the classic pong game, this one will be a 2 to 4 player experience where each player takes one side of the square that is the screen. If they let the ping-pong ball touch their side of the screen, they are eliminated, the last one standing will be rewarded a point. The first to seven points wins.

### Development
- Uses sockets to connect between clients and server.
- The actual game will be done using the pygame library.
- A server will be deployed so that people can connect outside of the local network of the host.

### Goals
- Learn how a simple game is coded, from its interface to how it takes user input in real time.
- Learn how a multiplayer game takes user input from their respective client and through the server updates everyones perspective.
- Learn how to deploy a server in the web, use logs to overview what is happening and get a general feel for hosting an app.
